--- the matlab codes of the Real-time Change Point Detector (RCPD2). RCPD2 is a mean CP detector that builds upon our previous introduced RCPD detector, published in [1] 

============================ Matlab codes =======================================

----> For a demon please launch the following scripts:

-1- LN.m contains an execution of RCPD2 algorithm across time-series generated through Log-Normal distribution, assuming several LN parameters.

-2- armagarch.m contains an execution of RCPD2 of RCPD2 algorithm over ARMA-GARCH generated time-series, assuming several ARMA-GARCH parameters.
